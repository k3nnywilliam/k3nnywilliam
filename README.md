### Hi I'm Kenny 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently learning how to use machine learning/deep learning for gene therapies and precision medicine.
- 💼 At the same time, I like to develop software applications for use in healthcare and medical imaging.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I belong to a native tribe called Iban in Malaysia and I used to be a 3D artist 🧑‍🎨
